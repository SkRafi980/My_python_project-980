# My Python Learning Journey

Hello! I'm Rafi.  
I'm in class 10. Yes, I am starting to learn Python right now to get better job opportunities in the future.  
I will share everything I learn about Python day by day here.

## 📚 What I have learned so far

Day 1  – I learned how to use `print()` and show output.

Day 2  – I learned what a `variable` is, how to take `input from the user`and made a small project that asked questions to the user.

Day 3  – I learned about `data types`, how to do `math` with numbers, and how to convert `user input from string to int` I also made a mini project.
